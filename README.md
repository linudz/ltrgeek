# LTRgeek, a fine LTR retrotransposon annotation pipeline

LTRgeek is a LTR retroelements annotation pipeline, based on LTR harvest () and implemented in the NextFlow DSL. Starting from assembled genomes in fasta, the pipeline performs a structural identification of putative LTR retroelements by LTR harvest, 

## Development status
By the day June 26th 2018, LTRgeek is under revision and assembly in NextFlow. Having ran and tested all the steps separately, the pipeline is now beeing assembled into a uniqe NextFlow - defined parallelised workflow.
