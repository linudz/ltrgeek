# LTRgeek, a fine LTR retrotransposon annotation pipeline

## Intro
LTRgeek is a LTR retroelements annotation pipeline, based on LTR harvest () and implemented in the NextFlow DSL. Starting from assembled genomes in fasta, the pipeline performs a structural identification of putative LTR retroelements by LTR harvest,
